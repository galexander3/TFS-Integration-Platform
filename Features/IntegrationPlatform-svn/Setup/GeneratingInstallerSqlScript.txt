Pre-requisites:
1. Install "Microsoft® Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition Power Tools"
2. If a run-time exception occurs when running sqlspp, you need to install the following feature packs
    SQLServer2005_ADOMD_x64.msi, SQLServer2005_XMO_x64.msi (Verified on w2k8 x64 machine)
3. Update the Tfs_IntegrationPlatform project property, to "Always re-create database" in the Build property page
   *AND* build the dbproj

TODO:
- currently the generateInstallerSQLScript.bat contains hard-coded paths. You may need to update the paths.

Steps:
1. Check out "Setup\Installation\Tfs_IntegrationPlatform.sql" file
2. [optional] You may need to update the hard-coded paths in Setup\generateInstallerSQLScript.bat
3. Run the "\Setup\generateInstallerSQLScript.bat" file
4. Edit 1 line in the newly generated "Setup\Installation\Tfs_IntegrationPlatform.sql" file
   - Remove machine-specific information at the line where it creates database [Tfs_IntegrationPlatform]
   - After removing the machine-specific information the line should look like below:
     CREATE DATABASE [Tfs_IntegrationPlatform] COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS
